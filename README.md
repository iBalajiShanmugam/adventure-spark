## Getting Started

To get started with the Adventure Works - Spark repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iBalajiShanmugam/adventure-spark.git`
2. Set up your Databricks environment and cluster.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to perform specific tasks on the Adventure Works dataset.

## Data Ingestion

The data ingestion process involves loading the Adventure Works dataset into your Databricks environment. The repository provides notebooks and scripts to ingest data from various sources, such as CSV files, databases, or external APIs. You can find the relevant code and instructions in the [data-ingestion](data-ingestion) directory.

## Data Processing

Once the data is ingested, the next step is to process and transform it for analysis. The data processing notebooks and scripts in the [data-processing](data-processing) directory demonstrate how to clean, transform, and aggregate the Adventure Works dataset using PySpark and Delta Lake.

## Data Analysis

With the data ingested and processed, you can perform various data analysis tasks on the Adventure Works dataset. The [data-analysis](data-analysis) directory contains notebooks that explore customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and return patterns, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.
